# Choose Backend Node Modules

## Status

<!-- What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.? -->
proposed

## Context

<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
To provide all necessary functions, several Node.js modules are needed.

## Modules

### Web Server

**Options:**
- HTTP(S)
- Express

#### Decision

<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->
Both options are widely used in the real world. In the following `express` is used because it provides an abstraction layer above the vanilla http module to make handling web traffic and APIs easier.


### File System

To use the file system the `fs` module is used.

#### File Tree

With the `fs` module itself, it is possible to read the entire file tree, but the `filetree` module saves a lot of additional work. Thats why it is used in addition to the `fs` module.

#### Search Folders

**Options:**
- find
- fs-find

#### Decision

<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->
The two modules do basically the same thing. `find` is used because it has a larger user base and has received an update more recent.


### Read Metadata

**Options:**
- ExifReader
- exifr
- exiftool

#### Decision

<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->
The `ExifReader` module is used because it is the only one of these tools that can read all the requested metadata.


### Set Global Variables

**Options:**
- env
- dotenv

#### Decision

<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->
`Dotenv` is used to set global variables, as it is updated more frequently than env and has a much larger user base.
